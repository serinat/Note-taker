### Note-taker

- The objective of this homework was to create an application that can be used to write, save and delete notes, using express backend and saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. Fortunately the frontend was already created with an index.html and notes.html and an assets folder containing css and index.js. While the frontend is usually my favorite part to work on, I can see how time-consuming it would be to create the entire application (especially during Thanksgiving break!).
